"i" button
Simple elegance of France in the 1960's. Average vehicle, but this is an iconic car in my favorite detective TV series.
You know Columbo? Most parts are clickable, find the evidences, click the right sequence, discover it secrets! Good luck!

--------------------

The project has two parts:

An animated car, and a little game.

1.
You can change the roof type, turn up the lights (only one indexlight works in the same time), open/close the doors, engine hood, windows, turn the steering wheel etc.

2.
A little game inspired by my fav detective tv series Columbo. Use "?" button. Find his cigar, and after that click on the evidences in the right sequence (appearance in the series) - there is a right/wrong feedback.
The cigar is front of the fr seat, and the right sequence is Degas pastel, blueprint, mirrored photo, Irish whiskey.

SPOILER
If you find the right sequence, the car changes to Columbo's car. Scratches, dust, his license plate... and the front light not work properly.
SPOILER END

You can reset (not everything) the scene with the reset button.
